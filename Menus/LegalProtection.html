<h1> Workplace legal protection status for the LGBT+ community </h1>
<div class="legalprotection"> 
<h3> Are people who identify to be of non-conforming genders and sexualities protected by American law? </h3>
<p> Yes. There are currently laws in the US that seek to protect employees who have non-conforming genders and sexualities from workplace discrimination and harrassment. </p>
<h3> What kinds of workplace protection for members of the LGBT+ community are there? </h3>
<p> Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - which also appears in volume 42, section 2000e onwards of the United States Code - prohibits employment discrimination based on, among other things, an individual's sex. </p>
<p> In <i>Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia</i>, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that "firing individuals because of their sexual orientation or transgender status violates Title VIIâ€™s prohibition on discrimination because of sex"<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/what-you-should-know-eeoc-and-protections-lgbt-workers"><sup>1</sup></a>. The rulings, however, did not touch on related issues, such as dress codes and bathroom or locker room access. </p>
