    <p> The above chart on the number of complaints in the US are reported by studies by the Williams Institute, with data collection dating back to 1999. As explained on the <a href="MainFigures.html"> Main Figures</a> page, the number of responses collected on the Workplace Equity Survey for non-heterosexual employees is much lower than that for heterosexual ones. While the LGBT community is truly still a minority at the moment, however, the problem with anti-LGBT workplace discrimination is in every way a grave one. As shown above in the charts, the number of administrative complaints (per 10,000) regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation is comparable to that based on race or sex (male/female). </p>

<p> The results of the studies above, which have included the transgender population, further confirm that there is indeed <b>ongoing discrimination</b> against the LGBT community in workplace. </p>
<p> The apparent solution this is of course to make the American workplace <b>a more inclusive environment</b>. More indiscriminate employment policies should be established and observed. </p>
<p>In addition, we also need reconciliation and inclusion within the LGBT community. As observed throughout those studies above, the data from the Williams Institute, and the Workplace Equity Survey, it is not always possible to see the workplace treatment pattern for every subgroup within the community, which indicates that there is also underrepresentation among LGBT employees themselves. </p>
