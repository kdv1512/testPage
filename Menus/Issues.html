<h1> What are the current employment issues facing the LGBT+ community right now? </h1>    
<div>
<h3> Firing </h3>
<ul>
<li> 16% of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) respondents to the University of Chicago's <strong> General Social Survey </strong> reported having lost a job because of their sexuality.</li>
<li> 16% of transgender respondents to the National Center for Transgender Equality's <strong> 2015 US Transgender Survey </strong> also reported losing employment on account of their gender identity or expression. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3> Denial of promotion and hiring </h3>
<ul>
<li> 18% percent of LGB respondents to the GSS had experienced employment discrimination in applying for and/or keeping a job because of their sexual orientation. </li>
<li> 30% of transgender respondents to the USTS reported being fired, denied a promotion, or not hired for a job because of their gender identity or expression. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3> Verbal, physical, and sexual harassment </h3>
<ul>
<li> 35% of LGB respondents to the GSS reported ever having been harassed at work. 58% reported hearing derogatory comments about sexual orientation and gender identity in their workplaces. </li>
<li> 15% of respondents to the USTS who held a job in that year were verbally harassed, physically attacked, or sexually assaulted. </li>    
</ul>
<h3> Unsafe or inaccessible bathrooms </h3>
<ul>
<li> 59% of respondents to US Transgender Survey avoided using a public restroom in the last year, and nearly one third (32%) limited the amount they ate and drank to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Inadequate healthcare coverage </h3>
<ul> 
<li> LGBT+ employees may have different healthcare needs from their straight coworkers. Union negotiated health plans must meet the needs of their LGBT+ members, from covering gender transition-related care to covering HIV prevention and treatment. </li>    
</ul>
<h3> Benefit sharing based on outdated definitions of family </h3>
<ul> 
<li> Many union-negotiated employee benefits, such as healthcare and leave policies, are based on a legal definition of marriage and family. Even though same-sex marriage is legal, many LGBT+ families – among others – are not based around marriage for a variety of reasons.
 </li>
</ul>
<h3> Fear of coming out </h3>
<ul> 
<li> According to the GSS, 33% of LGB employees were not open about being LGB to anyone in the workplace. A staggering 53% of respondents to the USTS who had a job in the past year reported hiding their gender identity at work to avoid discrimination. </li>    
</ul>
<h3> Delays in resolving conflicts </h3>
<h3> Lack of representation </h3>
